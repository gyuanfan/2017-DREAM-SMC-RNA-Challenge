# Seekmer

This is the submitted version of Seekmer to DREAM SMC-RNA Challenge.

The C++ code has been uploaded in the Release page. To install the code, you need:

* A C++ compiler (GCC will do)
* Eigen library
* QtCore from Qt 5

The above are available through Anaconda Python distribution.

To install the code, download seekmer-0.0.zip and unpack the file. Change the last line of seekmer.pro to your Eigen library folder. Run "qmake seekmer.pro" should build the program.
